description:  This tool was developed primarily for health researchers and behavioral health experts to identify common physiological event sequences preceding smoking episodes. This application targets regular smokers as the primary user. Developed a web-based application consisting of two primary interfaces, the user interface, which enables behavior analysis of individual users, and the cohort interface, which enables behavior analysis across all users. 
more-description-tittle: Visualizations
more-description: Implemented the folloing visualizations Map View, Interactive Sankey Diagram, Participant Correlation Graphs and HRV Scatterplots. Map View  uses a familiar map interface to show locations where study participants have smoked. The analyst may select between participants using the drop-down menu, and scroll or zoom to interact with the map interface. When a smoking marker is selected, additional details become visible in a tooltip. This visualization addresses the task of identifying what environmental factors affect smoking behavior. Sankey diagram is a flow diagram that depicts many to many connections from one set of values to another. Sankey diagram makes it easy to identify many to many connections between nodes. Correlation graph draws a correlation network of relationships from tabular data based on pairwise correlations.
