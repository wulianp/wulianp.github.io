                <p class="about-p"> I'm a fourth year student at Western Washington University pursuing a degree in computer science and graduating Summer of 2019. I have experience developing and designing software for the web and mobile applications. </p>
                <p class="about-p">I love learning new and better ways to create technologies that help solve complex problems in underrepresented communities. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm  always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something that will empower individuals working along side people that bring out the best in me. </p>
